This project simulates a simple ATM machine where users can authenticate with a PIN, check their balance, withdraw or deposit money, and exit securely.

Developed as part of a problem-solving session for **GCIS-123: Software Development & Problem Solving I @ RIT Dubai**, it introduces basic conditional logic, user input, authentication, and transaction handling.
