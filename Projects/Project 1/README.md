# ðŸ©º Health Monitoring System (HMS)

This project simulates a basic health monitoring tool that collects pulse readings over multiple hours, calculates averages, flags abnormal values, alerts medical staff, and visualizes the results using **Turtle graphics**.

Developed as part of **GCIS-123: Software Development & Problem Solving I @ RIT Dubai**, this project integrates fundamental programming concepts with visual output.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Accepts 3 pulse readings per hour over a 4-hour period
- Calculates hourly average pulse values
- Detects and reports abnormal pulse levels (outside 60â€“100 bpm)
- Prints warnings for doctors when needed
- Draws a bar chart of pulse levels using the Turtle library
- Includes test functions for validation

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- Input validation and error handling
- Conditional logic and loops
- Modular design with testable functions
- Unit testing using assertions
- Turtle graphics for data visualization
