# gcis123-python-projects

A collection of hands-on Python projects completed for **GCIS-123: Software Development & Problem Solving I** at **RIT Dubai**.

These projects demonstrate core programming concepts including algorithmic thinking, problem solving, input/output operations, data visualization, file handling, and basic security techniques — all built using Python.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Console-based and GUI-based applications
- File I/O and data persistence
- Modular design and error handling
- Algorithm performance analysis
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Recursion and pattern generation
- Basic cryptography (Caesar Cipher)
- Hash functions and benchmarking
